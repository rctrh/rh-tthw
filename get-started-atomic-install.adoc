## Path Intro section
Get started with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host for container deployment.

## Prerequisites section title
Introduction and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites section
This tutorial provides an overview of the key steps for obtaining and installing link:http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host], which is a secure, minimal-footprint OS optimized to run Linux containers. You will create an Atomic Host installation on a virtual or physical machine using the Atomic Host ISO installer.

You will need a current Red Hat subscription that allows you to download software and updates from Red Hat. If you are interested in purchasing a Red Hat subscription for development, the link:https://www.redhat.com/apps/store/developers/rhel_developer_suite.html[Red Hat Developer Suite] is an affordable choice that includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, Atomic Host, Red Hat Developer Toolset, and Software Collections. For developer support with a guaranteed response time service-level agreement (SLA), Red Hat Developer Workstation Professional or Enterprise subscriptions are available. 

If you don’t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation]. Downloading and installing Atomic Host requires a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server evaluation. Typically, the recommended evaluation for developers is Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation because it includes Red Hat Software Collections and the Red Hat Developer Toolset, however that evaluation does not include Atomic Host. Therefore, you should select an evaluation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server.

For the installation, you will need a 64-bit x86 physical or virtual machine with at least 16 GB of available disk space. For more detailed link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-installation-planning-x86.html[minimum hardware requirements and compatibility information], see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide].

Note: This tutorial does not replace the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide]. Instead, this tutorial provides an overview of the key steps to obtain and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux for software developers. For detailed instructions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Installation Guide].

### Pre-built Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host VM Images

Pre-built Atomic Host VM images are available that can be used as an alternative to installing from scratch using the Red Hat Atomic Installer ISO image. Images are provided for many of the popular virtualization platforms as well as a number of cloud service providers. 

Should you choose to use a pre-built VM image, skip the installation section of this tutorial, and continue with the post-install steps.

If you are using Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or Fedora Linux, the Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) provides pre-built virtual machines (VMs) for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the Atomic Host edition. A paid subscription, such as link:https://www.redhat.com/apps/store/developers/rhel_developer_suite.html[Red Hat Developer Suite], is required to download the CDK.
Follow the CDK Installation Guide for your OS:
* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1487723[Installing the CDK on Microsoft Windows] +
* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1487693[Installing the CDK on Mac OS X] +
* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1487733[Installing the CDK on Fedora Linux]

If your system is running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, you can run an Atomic Host VM as a KVM guest. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-atomic-virtualization.html#sect-atomic-virtualization-libvirt[Using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host in Virtualized Environments]. On the download page, select _Red Hat Atomic Cloud Image_ to download the qcow2 file.

[*FIXME* - NOTE TO REVIEWERS, The above paragraph could be for RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora and the instructions provided should work on all of those.  Probably they would work on other Linux systems with libvirt such as Ubuntu.  Please let me know what you feel it should be.]

The installation guide, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-atomic-virtualization.html[Using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host in Virtualized Environments] also covers:
* Red Hat Enterprise Virtualizatoin (RHEV)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
* VMware
* Microsoft Hyper-V
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Compute Engine (GCE)

Note: The pre-built Atomic VM images do not have a default username and password, the cloud-init tool is used to create them. You will need to create a separate ISO file containing your login credentials to use with cloud-init.

If you are using an evaluation, you must first agree to the terms and conditions at link:https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/[www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/].
+
*NOTE TO REVIEWERS: There may be a bug here, or a recent problem with the customer portal. I can't register the system with an eval, due to the agreement. I've tried visiting that link from another system, that still won't get me past the first-boot registration page.  There may be a bug that prevents registration at first boot. Lately I'm getting a Java error returned which I think is from the portal.*
+
. Log in to the system with the username and password you created during installation.
+
If you didn't create a regular user, you will need to log in as root and create a user. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.
+
If you get a text-based login screen instead of a graphical one, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.
+
. Select your preferred language.


### Install the latest updates

In this step, you will download and install the latest updates for your system from Red Hat. In the process, you will verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates.

First, start a _Terminal_ window from the _Application_ menu.  Then, after using `su` to change to the root user ID, use `subscription-manager` to verify that you have access to Red Hat software repositories. 

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
```

If you don’t see any enabled repositories, your system might not be registered with Red Hat or might not have a valid subscription. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

Now download and install any available updates by running `yum update`.  If updates are available, `yum` will list them and ask if it is OK to proceed.

`# yum update`

### Enable additional software repositories

In this step you will configure your system to obtain software from the RHSCL software repository. The RHSCL repository includes the both the RHSCL software collections as well as DTS (the Red Hat Developer Toolset). RHSCL includes the latest stable versions of dynamic languages, open source databases, and web development tools that can be deployed alongside those included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. DTS provides the latest, stable, open source C and {cpp} compilers and complementary development tools, including Eclipse.  

Instructions are provided for both the command line (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI).

#### Using the Red Hat Subscription Manager GUI

Red Hat Subscription Manager can be started from the _System Tools_ group of the _Applications_ menu. Alternatively, you can start it from the command prompt by typing `subscription-manager-gui`. +

. On the Subscription Manager _System_ menu, select _Repositories_.
. In the list of repositories, check the _Enabled_ column for _rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms_ and _rhel-7-server-optional-rpms_. Note: After clicking, it might take several seconds for the check mark to appear in the _Enabled_ column. +
 
If you don’t see any RHSCL repositories in the list, your subscription might not include it.
[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/softwarecollections/softwarecollections_install_1.png')}[Manage Repositories]

See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information. +


#### Using subscription-manager from the command line

You can add or remove software repositories from the command line using the `subscription-manager` tool as the root user. Use the `--list` option to view the available software repositories and verify that you have access to RHSCL, which includes DTS:

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list | egrep rhscl
```

If you don’t see any RHSCL repositories in the list, your subscription might not include it. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

[.code-block]
```
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
```

## Faq section title
[[troubleshooting]]Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Faq section
. My system is unable to download updates from Red Hat.
+
Your system must be registered with Red Hat using `subscription-manager register`. You need to have a current Red Hat subscription or an evaluation.
. I don't have a current Red Hat subscription, can I get an evaluation?
+
If you don’t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation]. Downloading and installing Atomic Host requires a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server evaluation. Typically, the recommended evaluation for developers is Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation because it includes Red Hat Software Collections and the Red Hat Developer Toolset, however that evaluation does not include Atomic Host. Therefore, you should select an evaluation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server.
+
. I can't find the Red Hat Atomic Installer ISO file.
+
On the Red Hat Enterprise Linux download page, under _Product Variant_ select, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host_.  You may need to scroll down to find it.
+
Some minor releases, e.g. 7.1.4, may not include an updated Atomic Installer ISO file. Under _Product Version_ select the most recent major release, such as 7.1.0, or 7.0.
+
. Under _Product Variant_ I don't have an option for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host.
+
You must have a subscription for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, or a paid Developer Workstation subscription for access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host. You can also download Atomic Host by starting a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server evaluation.
+
. How do I install the C/{cpp} compiler or other software development tools on Atomic Host?
+
Why can't I install software on Atomic Host using yum, rpm, or package manager?
+
*FIXME* 
+
. I didn't configure a network connection during installation, how do I this on a running system?
+
If you did not configure a network connection during installation or the configuration was unsuccessful, see the instructions in link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-atomic-getting-started[Getting Started with Red Hat Atomic Host].

. How do I register my system after installation?
+
Use Red Hat Subscription Manager, which can be started from the system menu as a graphical tool, or from the command line using the following command:
+
`# subscription-manager register --auto-attach`
+
For more information see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273[How to register and subscribe a system to the Red Hat Customer Portal using Red Hat Subscription Manager].

. What's the username and paswsword for the pre-built VM images?
+
The pre-built Atomic VM images do not have a default username and password, the cloud-init tool is used to create them. You will need to create a separate ISO file containing your login credentials to use with cloud-init. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-atomic-virtualization.html[Using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host in Virtualized Environments].
. Can I run and build docker containers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux?
+
Red Hat Enterprise Linux includes docker, but it is not installed by default. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893#get[Getting Docker on RHEL 7] in the article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems].
. Where can I learn more about delivering applications with Linux containers?
+
If you haven't already joined the link:http://developers.redhat.com/[Red Hat Developers program], sign up at link:http://developers.redhat.com/[developers.redhat.com]. Membership is free.+
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1483053[Recommended Practices for Container Development] and many other container articles are available from the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].+
If you are a Red Hat Technology Partner, visit the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1483053[Container Zone] at the link:http://connect.redhat.com/[Red Hat Connect for Technology Partners] web site.
. When I start Atomic Host, I don't see a graphical environment.
+
Atomic Host is specifically optimized for deploying of Linux containers in environments like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. Atomic Host's minimal footprint contains only the software needed to efficiently host containers. Since it does not include a graphical user interface or development tools, Atomic Host isn't well suited for software development activities. Instead, developers should use Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is design to suit many purposes including desktop and server installations. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems]. After an application is developed and packaged in a container, developers can test them on Atomic Host to ensure it is ready for deployment. Atomic Host can be helpful for developers who are creating continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) environments.
