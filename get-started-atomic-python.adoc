## Path Intro section
Get started building Python application containers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host in under 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites section title
Introduction and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites section
In this tutorial, you will see how to deploy a Python 3 application in containers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host. Atomic Host is a secure, minimal-footprint OS optimized to run Linux containers.

You will need to have Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host installed on a virtual (or physical) machine. You will also need a current Red Hat subscription that allows you to download software and updates from Red Hat.

[Keep or delete??] If you donâ€™t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[]. Downloading and installing Atomic Host requires a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server Evaluation. Generally, developers should select the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation option to ensure the evaluation includes Red Hat Software Collections and the Red Hat Developer Toolset, however that evaluation does not include Atomic Host. *FIXME*

If you are interested in purchasing a Red Hat subscription for development, the link:https://www.redhat.com/apps/store/developers/rhel_developer_suite.html[Red Hat Developer Suite] is an affordable choice that includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, Atomic Host, Red Hat Developer Toolset and Software Collections.  

The best way to get started with Atomic Host depends on what OS you are using on your development system:

* If you are using Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or Fedora Linux, the Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) provides pre-built virtual machines (VMs) for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the Atomic Host edition. A paid subscription, such as link:https://www.redhat.com/apps/store/developers/rhel_developer_suite.html[Red Hat Developer Suite], is required to download the CDK.
Follow the CDK Installation Guide for your OS:
** link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1487723[Installing the CDK on Microsoft Windows] +
** link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1487693[Installing the CDK on Mac OS X] +
** link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1487733[Installing the CDK on Fedora Linux] 
* If you are already running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 server, you can run this tutorial directly on your system after configuring your system to run `docker`. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893#get[Getting Docker on RHEL 7] in the article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems].
* If you'd like to install Atomic on a physical machine or build your virtual machine, see Get Started with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host. [*NOTE: FIXME: This should be a link to the Atomic Get Started guide that is part of this "get started" site*, not the KB article, https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-atomic-getting-started, Note: the names are too similar need to come up with something different.]
* [FIXME/TODO] - Is there a documented path for running Atomic Host under KVM on RHEL?  There is a qcow2 download that is listed as a "Cloud Image" instead of a "KVM image" the way it is listed for RHEL server/workstation.  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-atomic-virtualization.html[] 

### About Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host

Atomic Host is specifically optimized for the deployment of Linux containers in environments such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. Its minimal footprint contains only the software needed to efficiently host containers. Since it does not include a graphical user interface, or development tools, Atomic Host isn't suited for software development activities. Instead, developers should use Red Hat Enterprise Linux which is designed to suit many purposes including desktop and server installations. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems]. After an application has been developed and packaged in a container, developers may want to test them on Atomic Host. Atomic Host can be helpful for developers that are creating continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) environments.

If you encounter difficulties at any point in this tutorial, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.

## Step1 Content

In this step, you will download and install the latest updates from Red Hat for your Atomic Host installation. In the process, you will verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates.

Note: If you are not using Atomic Host and following this tutorial on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893#get[Getting Docker on RHEL 7] in the article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems].

The process for installing updates on Atomic Host is different than other Red Hat systems. On Atomic Host, updates are applied atomically in a single, indivisible step. Likewise, updates can also be rolled back in a single step. Most of the file systems on Atomic Host are mounted read-only, only `/etc` and `/var` are writable. Yum is not used for installing updates or software. Instead, the `rpm-ostree` system is used for installing updates. Software is installed using docker containers.

Log in to your virtual (or physical) machine running Atomic Host as the root user, or use `su` or `sudo bash` to start a root session. If you haven't registered your system, you can do it with `subscription-manager`.  Use the same username and password that you use for logging in to the Red Hat Customer Portal, link:https://access.redhat.com/[access.redhat.com].  

`# subscription-manager register --username=<username> --auto-attach` * [mreid] <username> should be italic, but not sure how to do italic text markup*

To install the latest updates, use the following command:

`# atomic host upgrade`

To see the new version that got installed, use the following command:

`# atomic host status`

The asterisk at the beginning of the line indicates which version the system is current running. To make the update take effect, you must reboot the system.

`# systemctl reboot`

After the system reboots `atomic host status` should confirm that the system is running the latest version.

If you encounter difficulties at any point, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.

## Step2 Content

This step will download and install Python 3 using a container from the Red Hat container registry. Installing the Python 3 container will make Python 3 available for use by other containers on your system. Because containers run in isolated environments, your host system will not be altered by the installation. You must use `docker` commands to use or view the container's content.

The commands shown in this section can be used for downloading and installing other containers, such as application containers you build. Containers can specify that they require other containers to be installed, which can happen automatically. When you build an application in a container that uses Python 3, you can specify that it requires Python 3 in the `Dockerfile` that is used to describe and build your container. Then when someone installs your container, their system will automatically download the required Python 3 container directly from the Red Hat container registry.

The Python 3 container is part of Red Hat Software Collections which provides the latest development technologies for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Access to the Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) is included with many Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subscriptions. For more information about which subscriptions include RHSCL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793[How to use Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) or Red Hat Developer Toolset (DTS)].

Note: If you are not using Atomic Host and following this tutorial on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, you should have already installed `docker`.  See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893#get[Getting Docker on RHEL 7] in the article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems].

If you don't have a root session running on your container host, log in as the root user, or use `su` or `sudo bash` to start a root session.

To download and install the Python 3 container, use the following command:

`docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/python-33-rhel7`

The `docker images` command should show the container image that was installed as well as any others that are on your system.

`# docker images`

Now start a bash shell inside the Python 3 container to have a look around. The shell prompt changes, which is an indication that you are typing at the shell inside the container. A `ps -ef` shows the only thing running inside the container is `bash` and `ps`. Type `exit` to leave the container's bash shell.

[.code-block]
```
# docker run -it openshift3/python-33-rhel7 /bin/bash
bash-4.2$ which python3
/opt/rh/python33/root/usr/bin/python3
bash-4.2$ python3 --version
Python 3.3.2
bash-4.2$ ps -ef
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
default      1     0  0 21:56 ?        00:00:00 /bin/bash
default     11     1  0 21:58 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
bash-4.2$ exit
```

The prior `docker run` command created a container to run your command, keep any state, and isolate it from the rest of the system. You can view the list of running containers with `docker ps`. To see all of the containers that have been created, included those that have exited, use `docker ps -a`.

You can restart the container that was created above with `docker start`. Containers are referred to by name. Docker will automatically generate a name if you don't provide one. Once the container has been restarted, `docker attach` will let you interact with the shell running inside of it.  See the following example:
 
[.code-block]
```
# docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
c3e47aafe6d1        openshift3/python-33-rhel7   "/bin/bash"         23 seconds ago      Exited (0) 19 seconds ago                       high_kowalevski     
[root@rhdsrvr httpd-project]# docker start high_kowalevski
high_kowalevski
[root@rhdsrvr httpd-project]# docker attach high_kowalevski
```

At this point you are connected to the running shell inside the container. When you attach, you won't see the command prompt, so hit Enter get it to print another one. * [mreid] when you're accessing Atomic Host over SSH and you run an attach, it will give you a prompt*

[.code-block]
```
bash-4.2$ ps -ef
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
default      1     0  0 14:53 ?        00:00:00 /bin/bash
default     10     1  0 14:53 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
bash-4.2$ exit
```

Since bash was told to `exit`, the container will no longer be running. This can be verified with `docker ps -a`. Containers that are no longer needed can be cleaned up with `docker rm <container-name>`. * [mreid] <container-name> should be italics*

`docker rm high_kowalevski`

To see what other containers are available in the Red Hat container registry, use one or more of the following searches:

[.code-block]
```
# docker search registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3
# docker search registry.access.redhat.com/jboss
# docker search registry.access.redhat.com/rhel
```

## Step3 Content

In this step, you will create a tiny Hello World container that uses Python 3 as a web server. Once created, the container can be run on other systems that have `docker` installed.  You will need to create several files, including a `Dockerfile` which describes the container in an empty directory using your favorite editor. You don't need to be running under the root user to create the files, but you will need root privileges to run the `docker` commands.

First, create an empty directory, and then create a file named `index.html` with the following contents:

.index.html
----
<html>Hello, Red Hat Developers World!</html>
----

Now in the same directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following contents. Change the `MAINTAINER` line to have your name and email address.

.Dockerfile
----
FROM openshift3/python-33-rhel7:latest

MAINTAINER Your Name "your-email@example.com" 

EXPOSE 8000

COPY . /opt/openshift/src

CMD /bin/bash -c 'python3 web.py'
----

* [mreid] Your Name and "your-email@example.com" should be italics, they're placeholders the reader should replace *

Create the file `web.py` with the following contents:

.web.py
----
#
# A very simple Python HTTP server
#

import http.server
import socketserver


PORT = 8000

Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)

print("serving at port", PORT)
httpd.serve_forever()
----


Now build the container image with the following command. You will need to be root using `su` or `sudo` in the directory you created that above that contains `Dockerfile` and `index.html`.

[.code-block]
```
# docker build -t myname/pythonweb .
```
* [mreid] myname should be italics*

You can see the container image that was created using the following command.

[.code-block]
```
# docker images
```

Now run the container using the following command. The Python 3 http.server module will create a tiny web server listening on port 8000 inside the container.  The `run` command will map port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container.

[.code-block]
```
# docker run -d -p 8000:8000 myname/pythonweb
```
* [mreid] myname should be italics*

The run command returned a ID for the container which you can ignore.  To check that the container is running use the following command.  Take note of the name docker assigned to the running container.

[.code-block]
```
# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES
7d3b47bfded6        myname/pythonweb    "/bin/sh -c '/bin/ba   18 seconds ago      Up 17 seconds       8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   grave_brown   
```

Use `curl` to access the Python web server:

[.code-block]
```
# curl http://localhost:8000/
<html>Hello, Red Hat Developers World!</html>
```

When you are done, stop the running container with the following command using the name obtained from running `docker ps`

[.code-block]
```
# docker kill grave_brown
```
